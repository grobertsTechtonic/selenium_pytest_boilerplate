Feature: Sample
    As a developer
    I want a pytest-selenium bdd boilerplate
    So that I can skip the configuration when I start a project

    Scenario: Sample syntax
        Given a thing is true
        When I do "<x>" thing
        Then a thing should happen

        Examples: x
            | x |
            | 1 |
            | 2 |
            | 3 |
